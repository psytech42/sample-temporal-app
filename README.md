## Sample Temporal App

A small app that uses the Temporal Go SDK to trigger and execute workflows. It is based on Temporal's [Go SDK Example](https://github.com/temporalio/money-transfer-project-template-go).

The app expects the environment variable `TEMPORAL_CLUSTER_HOST`, and assumes the port is 7233.
